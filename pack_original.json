A new brand platform YES TO FRESH was introduced, adding a direct product role with youthful energy and entertainment value. Mentos was defined as a hit of delicious freshness which excites the mouth and awakens the mind, to new experiences, new opportunities. When we choose Mentos, we say Yes to Fresh. Moving further, Mentos\u2019 challenge is to build the emotional side of the brand. Mentos is in the back of young people\u2019s brains, but not first choice while in front of shelf.\n\nTo tackle this, Mentos is developing a global Yes to Fresh campaign for the categories Candy and Gum in 2022. The global insight is that people are stuck in the stale everyday and looking to freshen things up. The creative idea is to refresh the stale everyday. Mentos provides consumers the chance to see the world around them differently with a fresh perspective, refreshing the stale everyday moments.\n\nFor gum, 2 routes have been developed (\u2018Icy\u2019 and \u2018Snowball\u2019).\n\n## Objectives\n\nMain goal of the study is to test how the different creatives perform, which route resonates most with the target audience (16-39, chewing gum consumers) and what optimizations can be done.\n\nImportant questions that need an answer are:\n- Is the ad able to build the emotional side of the brand / make it more relevant?\n- Which route resonates most?\n- Which scenes work best?\n- Does the target group get the messages?\n- Is the message delivered in an engaging way?\n\nThe two gum routes have been tested via LinkExpress with neuro module in the Netherlands and USA.\n\nAction standards:\n- Branding, Enjoyment, Persuasion, understanding > 30th percentile\n- STSL, Involvement > 70th percentile\n- Message Check A > 50th percentile\n\nKANTAR\n2\n\nEND OF PAGE: 2",

Viewers mention that the idea is uncredible, showing that the concept struggles to resonate in NL.\n\n## Associations\n- Icy is very well able to convey its most important association of giving freshness/fresh breath.\n- It struggles to convey more metaphorical messages around the concept. People don\u2019t strongly pick up the story of Mentos getting you out stale everyday.\n\n## Predisposition\n- The lack in relevance mainly explains the low ability to stimulate persuasion in NL.\n- Long term impact is moderate. It will be able to create meaning and difference for Mentos, but only to an average extend.\n\n# Summary - USA\n\n## Engagement\n- In the USA, cut through potential is better. Consumers are more receptive to the concept, have therefore less trouble understanding and don\u2019t mind the ad being less believable.\n- This allows the viewer to enjoy the concept more and in turn have an easier time in linking Icy to Mentos.\n\n## Associations\n- Icy conveys the association of freshness/fresh breath\n- Associations around the concept (refresh the stale) are moderate, but stronger than in NL.\n\n## Predisposition\n- Viewers are a bit more open to the concept as they find it more relevant and believable. This positively impacts persuasive power in the US.\n- Icy also shows potential in building Mentos on the long term brand as it offers meaning and tells something different.\n\nKANTAR 43\nEND OF PAGE: 43",

                    "Text": "START OF PAGE: 44\nGum Icy\n\n# Recommendations Icy\n\n- Icy catches the attention but doesn\u2019t have a real strong link to Mentos because the concept and role of Mentos in the story are not fully understood at the moment. It is only about freshness now (which other gums also are about).\n\n- But the construct of **refresh the everyday stale** is new to consumers and new constructs need time and pressure to land. Also having in mind previous Mentos campaigns often struggle creating a strong brand linkage, we think it is **worth considering optimization**. We see some clear points for improvement:\n\n  - **Get closer to a traditional build**: problem \u2013 solution (=product) \u2013 relief moment\n    - **Emphasize the boringness in the beginning**, also in expression\n    - **Exaggerate fun moments** to create contrast to the boringness in the beginning: people having fun with each other\n    - Create an **after-effect**. Now we only see people moving backwards with the icy animations. But is there some kind of relief, or real new situation that is different from the boring previous one and also really relevant?\n    - Make clear what the **benefit** is for consuming Mentos. We give a reason, but no benefit.\n    - Think of **verbally supporting** messages around the concept getting out of everyday stale\n    - Keep the **edginess** because it attracts the attention\n    - It might be worth **reconsidering the music**. Some like it, some don\u2019t and it seems not super enjoyed and supportive now.\n\n- We believe the above suggestions will improve understanding and relevance and will therefore give the ad more potential to impact Mentos. The \u2018silliness\u2019 will be better accepted if it\u2019s part of a more logically built story.\n\nKANTAR\n\n44\nEND OF PAGE: 44",

The ad is strong at bringing fun, but is also found disturbing and irritating.\n- There is an issue again in understandability. Viewers are not able to process what they are seeing making it unable to fit to the brand and therefore not able to link it.\n\n## Associations\n- Snowball is conveying freshness/fresh breath very well and that it is for everyone very strongly.\n- There are again struggles in conveying the refreshment of your daily boring moments, that it is innovative and that it adds fun.\n\n## Predisposition\n- Snowball is able to drive purchase at market norm level as viewers find the ad relevant. This is getting held back by a low believability.\n- Snowball is somewhat meaningful and seen as different in NL. It has average potential to build Mentos on the long term in NL.\n\n# Summary - USA\n\n## Engagement\n- Snowball has the same issues in the US as in NL. But US consumers are less able to find the fit with Mentos as the concept is not clear to everyone.\n- Enjoyability is also moderate and viewers mention that the ad is disturbing, irritating and unpleasant.\n\n## Associations\n- The message take out has similar issues in the US. Good conveyance of freshness/fresh breath but struggles to do so for the higher conceptual messages like adding fun to your life, refreshing daily boring moments and being innovative.\n\n## Predisposition\n- The short- and long-term effectiveness is where the US is lacking behind for Snowball compared to NL. The American audience find Snowball not relevant or believable at all. This in turns results in a weak persuasive power and not being meaningful or different.\n\nKANTAR\n80\n\nEND OF PAGE: 80",

The difference with Icy is that it is **more extreme in terms of craziness and fun**. This results in even more problems with understandability (and brand linkage). The absurdism resonates better in NL than in the US.\n\n- Also here, we are talking about a new subconstruct (refresh the everyday stale) that needs time. In the end we think it is **slightly safer to go with Icy**, but the difference is minimal. All in all, it might be **worth considering optimization** Snowball. We see positive elements and some clear points for improvement:\n\n  - **Get closer to a traditional build**: problem \u2013 solution (=product) \u2013 relief moment\n    - **Emphasize the problem in the beginning.** The situation is not really boring, therefore the sudden popping up of the snowball is not understood.\n    - **Don\u2019t make the middle scenes too long.** Keep in mind it is silly and there is no Mentos at all.\n    - Create a more clear **after-effect.** It is for example not clear why the Snowball stops in the office. We also see attention is lacking a bit in the end scenes.\n    - Make clear what the **benefit** is for consuming Mentos. We give a reason, but no benefit.\n    - Keep the **edginess and fun** because it attracts the attention\n    - Change the **music.** It is really disliked by a large group. It should be catchy and edgy though.\n\n- We believe the above points will help better accepting the craziness of the ad, because it will be better understood.\n\nKANTAR\n81\n\nEND OF PAGE: 81",

When people look at print ads, there are high levels of distraction so it would need to attract attention by being interesting and/or standing out, as well as engage readers. On the other hand, people are on the move when seeing outdoor and point of sale ads, so it is crucial that these ads grab and hold attention. But creativity is not a means unto itself, the engaging elements of the ad must be strongly linked to the brand.\n\n**Brand Predisposition:**  \nIs my ad helping in building my brand equity and/or encouraging purchase?\n\nStrong advertising will build predisposition for the brand in both the short and the long term. Persuasion measures the increase in short-term purchase intention brought about by the ad \u2013 but most ads do not pay for themselves in the short-term. Brands which are meaningful, different and salient command a greater market share, are more likely to grow and can justify charging a premium. Affinity, Meets Needs, Dynamic and Brand Difference measure whether the associations your ad is building position the brand as meaningful and different and in so doing, have the potential to contribute to long term success.\n\n**Brand Associations:**  \nDid my ad communicate the intended message?\n\nAdvertising should build associations for the brand in line with the desired brand strategy.\n\nKANTAR\n83\n\nEND OF PAGE: 83",

It is used to understand how one metric complements the other. An example is to know how much an average Persuasion can build up the short term sales potential of a high AI. It is a predictive metric to assess the probability of the advert to boost sales when on air, solely based on the copy quality. Short term share changes are subject to many influences, some of which, particularly those relating to price, can be large. Despite this, the underlying relationship seen with the STSL is clear and compelling.\n\n# Short Term Effects Likelihood (STEL)\n\nThe STEL is a summary of the Awareness Index and Persuasion scores combined together provided for long-term purchase and services brands. It is used to understand how one metric complements the other. An example is to know how much an average Persuasion can build up the short term effects potential of a high AI. Unlike FMCG/CPG brands, even very effective advertising may not lead to a short-term uplift in sales for brands with a longer purchase cycle, but we would still expect a positive impact on predisposition towards the brand in the time immediately following the ad airing. The likelihood of a short term uplift in brand predisposition is what the STEL seeks to predict.\n\n# Awareness Index\n\nThe Awareness Index is by far the most important and validated metric and the backbone of Link\u2122, the most important determinant of ad success. It tells you the incremental gains in advertising awareness an advert will generate per unit of media spend, so a bad AI means the rest of the advert\u2019s performance is inconsequential because the advert and the brand are unlikely to be remembered by those exposed to it. Independently validated against both long and short term sales changes, the AI is particularly key for established brands as learned in our validation exercises. It is predictive and calculated with mean scores of Enjoyment, Active Involvement and Branding. As there is an underlying relationship between \u2018Expressiveness\u2019 from Facial Coding and sales uplift, we saw that when we include Expressiveness in the impact prediction alongside branding, enjoyment & active involvement, the sales validation proved to be even stronger. So, from August 2017, if a Link\u2122 test has Facial Coding, the Expressiveness score will be added to the AI prediction as it provides a measure of the intuitive emotional reaction to an alongside the reflective response.\n\n# Impact Score\n\nThe Impact Score is a measure of the overall effectiveness of your creative in generating creative impact or breakthrough which is linked to the brand. Each media type has a different Impact Score calculation, taking into account what is more important to create engagement for its creatives.\n\nKANTAR\n84\n\nEND OF PAGE: 84",

Persuasion is the other sales validated metric of Link, but it is different than Awareness Index; a high score in Persuasion doesn\u2019t guarantee a high score in AI. And the big difference among each other is clear when we diagnose the sales validation: small/new brands are more affected by Persuasion, while Medium/Big brands are more affected by AI.\n\n### Power Contribution/Power Indicator\n\nThe Power Contribution/Indicator score is a summary metric that is specifically validated to an increase in Brand Equity. It is a composite of the Meaningful, Different and Salient scores.\n\n### Percentile\n\nA percentile reports the percentage (rank) position at which a score sits in the relevant normative distribution. For example, a score at the 80th percentile reflects the value above which the top 20% of all scores achieved fall. Percentiles allow quick and easy comparisons of scores across different questions with different scales and norms.\n\n### Colour coding\n\nThe green/amber/red shading indicates the performance of the ad versus the normative distribution for that measure. Green shading reflects a score that sits in the top 30% of the normative distribution; amber reports a score from the middle 40%; and red a score from the bottom 30%.\n\n### Raw score\n\nIt is the score of the advert expressed in percentage or mean score without additional treatment. The mean score is the average point that consumers responses sits in the scale used and applied weights to each point of this scale. The Top Box Score is the percentage of the highest point of the scale.\n\nKANTAR\n85\n\nEND OF PAGE: 85",

MWB Everyday Rewards: respondent must have selected 6-12 yrs Age, AND Emotional Need \u2018To indulge, treat/rewards others\u2019 OR \u2018A treat or reward from another\u2019 OR Functional need \u2018Give a nice taste/flavour in mouth\u2019\n\n- The Sized MWBs are not mutually exclusive as selected variables.  \n  E.g. \u2018A treat or reward from another\u2019 were important variables in different MWBs.  \n  The sum of the MWBs per OSP do therefore not equal the total size of the OSP.\n\n## Approach to MWB Category Fit:\n- Using the same variables for the sizing exercise, each category was assessed against their delivery on those key variables. Based on their delivery, categories were further given a score where red = under-delivering, orange = average delivery, green = over-delivering\n\n6\n\nEND OF PAGE: 6",

The challenge for PvM is to use their portfolio to challenge Wrigley\u2019s Extra\u2019s leadership.\n\n1. Firming up loyalty: Our brands struggle with loyalty conversion, we need to create better triggers to make our minds top of mind when the need to buy arises, and create enticing brand experiences that bring consumers back for more.\n\n2. To do this we need to drive our right to play in the market. Meaning is extremely important in this regard, we need to strengthen our emotional bond, and ensure that consumers \u201ctry and like\u201d our brands.\n\n3. Part of getting this right is delivering better higher order emotive and functional benefits that also reinforce better value discrimination in the category.\n\nKANTAR | PERFETTI van Melle\nEND OF PAGE: 13",

The same is also true for Mentos Gum and Smint. At the same time, none of our brands win in-market. Rather, we notice a **lack of return customers**, as consumers lack of \u201ctrying & liking\u201d of our brands limits purchase.\n\nThese signs indicate our brands should focus on improving their usage funnels by working to attract previous customers back. This can be done in the short term by adjusting in-market factors: ensuring our products are shown more prominently/extensively in stores, implementing price promotions or even offering samples in some locations (which could also help to attract new trialists).\n\nHowever, along with pursuing more temporary measures to attract customers and encourage repeat purchases, we recommend to focus the effort around the stable and long-term lever of **equity activation**, mainly through **building Meaningfulness**. Additionally, it may be helpful to execute some qualitative research to understand in depth why customers tend to not re-purchase our brands.\n\n## Brand Equity\n\nIn terms of brand power, Meaningfulness and Salience are the biggest contributors in our category. Even though brand communications awareness is \u201cfair\u201d for our brands, both Salience and Meaning are below average. Within the PvM portfolio, Mentos Candy has average Meaning but still relies more heavily on Salience for its power. More work is required to render our brands truly Meaningful brands that consumers remember and want to keep buying. This can be achieved by **differentiating brand imagery** and understanding what message to convey.\n\nCurrently, our brands (especially Mentos Gum and Smint) have very flat imagery profiles, possibly as a result of inconsistent ad messaging over the last years. Mentos has a strength in terms of shareability and is advised to keep focusing on the fun social aspect of the brand \u2013 but could develop a strength in the most important factor of Refreshing Quality as well. The statement **\u201cHas great tasting products\u201d** is largely unclaimed by other brands, and as Mentos Candy is doing fairly well in that regard (at +3, but not quite at +5 yet to make it a strength), the brand could focus future comms heavily around this product feature. As a functional benefit that is important to consumers, this will also drive Meaning for the brand.\n\nFor the Smint brand, the most effective positioning would be as a direct competitor to Wrigleys Extra by mostly emphasizing the refreshing and effective nature of the product. In this way, PvM can have a complementary portfolio, covering both functional as well as emotional category benefits.\n\nKANTAR Perfetti van Melle 66\nEND OF PAGE: 61",

What is your business problem statement?\n\n- Volume of beer consumption is declining across the UK (and also Belgium). Everyone is drinking less across all age groups, but we don't know if a particular age group is driving this decline at a more significant rate.\n- Our hypothesis is that younger age groups that are exiting the category are driving this decline.\n- Our household panel data is already showing that penetration is getting lower across the board.\n- This suggests people are stopping drinking beer rather than reducing consumption. We want to understand the reasons people are not drinking beer.\n  - Is it relative cost vs other alcohol categories, general financial pressure, bills - 10% inflation - things are 20% more expensive?\n  - People are not going out as often as they used to?\n  - What are they replacing beer with? Can of coke is now becoming the guilty pleasure instead of beer.\n  - Are they shifting to soft drinks? When?\n- Our objectives: How do we find the beer proposition that works for people who seem to be reducing beer consumption? What would keep them in the beer category? What product features, packaging, messaging, occasions? What needs would it address? Which occasions would it speak to?\n- Longer term, can we play in the soft drinks space? We have a Beyond Beer business unit which is focusing on adjacent opportunities to beer. It's mostly alcohol-based but we are looking at some non-alcoholic options. Non-alcoholic beer is more natural and healthier (no sugar, less calories, natural ingredients) than soft drinks. But consumers assume it has the same qualities as beer. What are the non-beer opportunities to grow ABV? What are the barriers for positioning non-alcoholic beer as a healthier soft drink alternative?\n\nFollow up questions?

Approximately 14% of respondents are aware of Twitter, aligning closely with Facebook and Instagram. This awareness translates into usage at a rate of 17%, again closely mirroring Facebook (17%) and Instagram (15%). Looking ahead, 15% of respondents indicate they would consider using Twitter in the future. However, Twitter's conversion from awareness to preference is low, with only 14% of users considering it their main social media platform, compared to Facebook's dominant 46%.\n\n### Associations & Perceptions\nTwitter's rebranding to 'X' appears to have maintained its position as a leading social media platform, but has not significantly enhanced its standing in user preference. The rebranding may have been perceived as a top-down decision, potentially leading to a sense of exclusion among users. This could have influenced their perception of the platform, and may explain the lower preference for Twitter as the main social media platform, despite high awareness and usage rates.\n\n### Drivers & Barriers\nThe rebranding of Twitter to 'X' without consumer consultation may have created a sense of exclusion among users, potentially influencing their perception and usage of the platform. This is reflected in the lower preference for Twitter as the main social media platform, despite high awareness and usage rates. The increased consumption of social media during the pandemic, platform differentiation, the shift from textual to visual content, and increasing privacy and security concerns may have further shaped these attitudes.\n\n### Key Metrics\nTwitter's rebranding to 'X' has not significantly shifted key metrics. While awareness and usage remain high at 14% and 17% respectively, preference as the main social media platform lags at 14%. This suggests that while the rebranding has maintained Twitter's position among the top three social media platforms, it has not significantly enhanced its standing or user preference.\n\n### Brand Purpose, Values & Mission\nThe rebranding of Twitter to 'X' may have been perceived as a top-down decision, potentially leading to a sense of exclusion among users, and lack of consideration. However, the rebranding may have been perceived as a top-down decision, potentially leading to a sense of exclusion among users and influencing their perception of the platform. This is reflected in the lower preference for Twitter as the main social media platform, despite high awareness and usage rates.

This includes understanding the factors that drive consumers to the category, their preferences for different types of gum, and the occasions when gum is the preferred choice. The research will also explore the emotional and functional benefits of gum, the impact of external factors such as quitting smoking and getting braces, and the evolution of gum consumption behaviors. Additionally, the research will delve into understanding all the positives and negatives of gum both from the product and category view, and any external factors impacting the category both positively and negatively. The insights from this research will inform the development of targeted marketing strategies and innovations to grow the gum category across different age groups.\n\n## Hypothesis\n\n1. We hypothesize that the relevance of gum may be declining among younger consumers due to shifts in lifestyle and societal trends.\n2. The role and perceived benefits of gum may vary by age group, with younger consumers potentially using gum for different reasons than older consumers.\n3. External factors such as quitting smoking and the rise of remote work due to Covid-19 may be impacting gum consumption habits.\n4. There may be external trends impacting gum habits right now such as things like - fortification, gum entering treating space, mental wellbeing and healthcare.\nEND OF PAGE: 9",

Tend to have a great variety of flavors and packaging styles.\n\n### Center filled pellets: an explosion of taste\nPerceived as fun, colorful and playful, they give the sense of surprise. They have an intense, indulging flavor, especially for the first minute where the pellet breaks and the liquid is tasted. It is understood to last longer than standard pellets.\n\n### Bubble gum: the big bubbles\nThey are linked to childhood memories, and it makes people smile. However, the size is too big and uncomfortable to chew for most adults. It is still revisited occasionally by a minority to have fun and laugh doing bubbles.\n\n### Slabs: the versatile gum\nA classic format established by Trident and associated with plain, single flavors and a level of hardness. They lack the crunchiness and juiciness of pellets, yet their flavor lasts longer.\n\n### Stick gum: the old time classic\nThey are linked to childhood memories, more old school and romantic. For many, it is too soft and tends to dissolve in the mouth. For some, the powdery substance is assumed as sugar which is a reason not to buy.\nEND OF PAGE: 58",

The sales in China shows that \u201ccube\u201d is more popular than \u201cPure fresh\u201d given the equal resources, which is contrary to the situation in other countries where \u201cPure fresh\u201d earns a larger market.

While the **Always With You** MWBs could be true across all Cleanse and Refresh refreshment themes, and the Gen-Z MWB rings true across the wide refreshment framework.\n\nThink of it as part of the cell phone, wallet, and keys bucket that you need to always have with you. It will be your daily dose of refreshment that is always available to you \u2013 an instant essential at home or on your commute, at work, out & about. Elevated pack designs that meet the requirements of being functional (dispensing, refilling, use with one hand) yet sleek and well-crafted to be a suitable essential that can be carried around and used in public without being conscious of others.\n\nOur \u201cEat.Drink.Clean.Smile\u201d solution! An opportunity to generate greater awareness of an immediate refreshment solution for any moment post-consumption with the purpose of cleansing the mouth, freshening the breath while, secondarily, cleaning teeth/mouth. It also provides, on the spot, the emotional uplift and confidence to get back to the work task at hand. Consider how to claim the moment across all touchpoints /P\u2019s. Be inspired by Coca-Cola\u2019s communications with meal accompaniment.\n\nA functional fix to look after the health of your mouth, and mouth in an easy and effective manner that sparks the more general feeling of strong, long-term health. Think of products that satisfy this functional need whilst also providing emotional benefits and enjoyment when consumed. An opportunity to educate consumers on how specific products can improve their (oral) health.\n\nBe the uplifting, confidence or mood booster consumers are looking for \u2013 claim that emotional position. Satisfying the need for minty, non-sticky, sugar-free products that are differentiated from competitors pushing the same product using emotional levers of confidence, upliftment, and confidence to do this. Consider multiple confidence elements at play in different scenarios e.g., work space, socializing, on the go, etc.\n\nAn opportunity to bridge the gap between young and old consumers, especially given the limited involvement of Gen Z in the refreshment space. Consider fruity-mint/fresh flavours (e.g., citrus) or exciting flavours and product experiences as an entry point to shift the perception on refreshment with a younger age cohort. Creating specific solutions that appeal to the different age cohorts and that, through local Jobs-to-be-done, we can take on an evolution of involvement in the refreshment journey as they age.\n\nConsumers look to float a tasty, fruity option that delivers a pleasant flavor in mouth, perfect for those moments when they want to uplift their and someone else's mood throughout a day; an option that allows relieving stress while cheering-up. Flavor is key: focus on fruity flavors and their emotional benefits while still delivering a refreshing sensation. A secondary opportunity stems from this for fitting in social occasions at work or on the go, when in a group of friends or co-workers. It is key for refreshment categories to cover consumers who look beyond traditional mint. With this in mind, categories should consider the right pack format that allows for shareability at work or on-the-go.\nEND OF PAGE: 17",

While again the Always With You MWBs could be true across all Cleanse and Refresh themes, and the Gen-Z MWB rings true across the wide refreshment framework.\n\n### Always With You\n\nThink of it as part of the cell phone, wallet, and keys bucket that you need to always have with you. It will be your daily dose of refreshment that is always available to you \u2013 an instant essential at home or on your commute, at work, out & about. Elevated pack designs that meet the requirements of being functional (dispensing, refilling, use with one hand) yet sleek and well-crafted to be a suitable essential that can be carried around and used in public without being conscious of others.\n\n### Post-Meal Refresh\n\nOur \u201cEat.Drink.Clean.Smile\u201d solution! An opportunity to generate greater awareness of an immediate refreshment solution for any moment post-consumption with the purpose of cleansing the mouth, freshening the breath while, secondarily, cleaning teeth/mouth. It also provides, on the spot, the emotional uplift and confidence to get back to the work task at hand. Consider how to claim the moment across all touchpoints /Ps. Be inspired by Coca-Cola\u2019s communications with meal accompaniment.\n\n### Teeth & Mouth Health\n\nA functional fix to look after the health of your mouth, and mouth in an easy and effective manner that sparks the more general feeling of strong, long-term health. Think of products that satisfy this functional need whilst also providing emotional benefits and enjoyment when consumed. An opportunity to educate consumers on how specific products can improve their (oral) health.\n\n### Refreshing Confidence Booster\n\nBe the uplifting, confidence or mood booster consumers are looking for \u2013 claim that emotional position. Satisfying the need for minty, non-sticky, sugar-free products that are differentiated from competitors pushing the same product using emotional levers of confidence, upliftment, and confidence to do this. Consider multiple confidence elements at play in different scenarios e.g., work space, socializing, on the go, etc.\n\n### Gen Z Refreshment\n\nAn opportunity to bridge the gap between young and old consumers, especially given the limited involvement of Gen Z in the refreshment space. Consider fruity-mint/fresh flavours (e.g., citrus) or exciting flavours and product experiences as an entry point to shift the perception on refreshment with a younger age cohort. Creating specific solutions that appeal to the different age cohorts and that, through local jobs-to-be-done, we can take on an evolution of involvement in the refreshment journey as they age.\n\n### Fruity Refreshment\n\nConsumers look for a tasty, fruity option that delivers a pleasant flavor in mouth, perfect for those moments when they want to uplift their or someone else's mood throughout a day; an option that allows relieving stress while cheering-up. Flavor is key: focus on fruity flavors and their emotional benefits while still delivering a refreshing sensation. A secondary opportunity within this is for fitting in social occasions at work or on the go, when in a group of friends or co-workers. It is key for refreshment categories to cover consumers who look beyond traditional mint. With this in mind, categories should consider the right pack format that allows for shareability at work or on-the-go.\n\n**Room for additional MWBs?**\nEND OF PAGE: 22",

It could also connect with Gen Z Refreshment, yet this MWB likely spans all themes. Again, the Always with You MWB could apply across all Cleanse and Refresh themes.\n\nThink of it as part of the cell phone, wallet, and keys bucket that you need to always have with you. It will be your daily dose of refreshment that is always available to you \u2013 an instant essential at home or on your commute, at work, out & about. Elevated pack designs that meet the requirements of being functional (dispensing, refilling, use with one hand) yet sleek and well-crafted to be a suitable essential that can be carried around and used in public without being conscious of others.\n\nOur \u201cEat.Drink.Clean.Smile\u201d solution! An opportunity to generate greater awareness of an immediate refreshment solution for any moment post-consumption with the purpose of cleansing the mouth, freshening the breath while, secondarily, cleaning teeth/mouth. It also provides, on the spot, the emotional uplift and confidence to get back to the work task at hand. Consider how to claim the moment across all touchpoints /P/s. Be inspired by Coca-Cola\u2019s communications with meal accompaniment.\n\nA functional fix to look after the health of your mouth, and mouth in an easy and effective manner that sparks the more general feeling of strong, long-term health. Think of products that satisfy this functional need whilst also providing emotional benefits and enjoyment when consumed. An opportunity to educate consumers on how specific products can improve their (oral) health.\n\nBe the uplifting, confidence or mood booster consumers are looking for \u2013 claim that emotional position. Satisfying the need for minty, non-sticky, sugar-free products that are differentiated from competitors pushing the same product using emotional levers of confidence, upliftment, and confidence to do this. Consider multiple confidence elements at play in different scenarios e.g., work space, socializing, on the go, etc.\n\nAn opportunity to bridge the gap between young and old consumers, especially given the limited involvement of Gen Z in the refreshment space. Consider fruity-mint/fresh flavours (e.g., citrus) or exciting flavours and product experiences as an entry point to shift the perception on refreshment with a younger age cohort. Creating specific solutions that appeal to the different age cohorts and that, through local Jobs-to-be-done, we can take on an evolution of involvement in the refreshment journey as they age.\n\nConsumers look for a tasty, fruity option that delivers a pleasant flavor in mouth, perfect for those moments when they want to uplift their and someone else's mood throughout a day; an option that allows relieving stress while cheering-up. Flavor is key: focus on fruity flavors and their emotional benefits while still delivering a refreshing sensation. A secondary opportunity within this is for offering in social occasions at work or on the go, when in a group of friends or co-workers. It is key for refreshment categories to cover consumers who look beyond traditional mint. With this in mind, categories should consider the right pack format that allows for shareability at work or on-the-go.\n\n----\n\nRoom for additional MWBs?\nEND OF PAGE: 27",

The **Morning Routine** MWB could be relevant across both Balance & Focus refreshment themes, as mornings are ideal moments to address needs for both mental clarity (Fresh Focus) and emotional balance (Restored Balance).\n\nConsumers need support that helps them stay sharp, an attention-strengthener, to help them re-focus when needed to carry out an activity (reading, working). This is about enhancing the mood they are in, to amplify a situation (0 to +10). It\u2019s a moment to unwind/stay away/not lean into the craziness and help you find the focus needed for your task at hand. Fulfill this need by adding attention-enhancing ingredients (functionally), by claiming this moment (emotionally). Focus on the working context, targeting professionals.\n\nConsumers mainly enjoy this moment after breakfast, in the morning - often on the go, in the car to work. These are very routine-rooted activities, recurring every (work)day. To leverage and claim this opportunity, we need to become the KitKat (\u2018Take a break\u2019) occasion of the morning. Design and claim (all Ps) in this morning touchpoint.\n\nConsumers need support to help alleviate stress during busy days when they have a lot on their plate and are looking for an escape. This is about easing the pressure, turning a (potentially) negative situation into a healthy, positive one again (-10 to 0). Something that will make them feel relaxed and at ease and take them to a space of peace and calm. Consider strong minty aromatics/exciting flavours to give a sensorial experience, taking their mind off those things that are stressing them out whilst they tackle the many tasks in the day.\n\nSoothing is a key element in this opportunity space - the physical effect and sensation it brings in the mouth; as well as the mental effect of comforting yourself, slowly getting back to a calmer, safer (emotional) space. Elevate the sensorial element of the solution - thinking through the 5 senses of the consumer and catering to them to feel balanced and relaxed. Highlight both emotionally what \u201csoothing\u201d means to the different age groups - the type of mental comfort and development is different for younger vs older age cohorts. Focus on after work, before going to bed and distracting moments on the go.\n\nRoom for additional MWBs?\n\n\nEND OF PAGE: 32",

Again, claiming the **Morning Routine** MWB could be relevant across both Balance & Focus refreshment themes.\n\nConsumers need support that helps them stay sharp, an attention-strengthener, to help them re-focus when needed to carry out an activity (reading, working). This is about enhancing the mood they are in, to amplify a situation (0 to +10). It\u2019s a moment to unwind/stay away/not lean into the craziness and help you find the focus needed for your task at hand. Fulfill this need by adding attention-enhancing ingredients (functionally), by claiming this moment (emotionally). Focus on the working context, targeting professionals.\n\nConsumers mainly enjoy this moment after breakfast, in the morning - often on the go, in the car to work. These are very routine-rooted activities, recurring every (work)day. To leverage and claim this opportunity, we need to become the KitKat (\u2018Take a break\u2019) occasion of the morning. Design and claim (all Ps) in this morning touchpoint.\n\nConsumers need support to help alleviate stress during busy days when they have a lot on their plate and are looking for an escape. This is about easing the pressure, turning a (potentially) negative situation into a healthy, positive one again (-10 to 0). Something that will make them feel relaxed and at ease and take them to a space of peace and calm. Consider strong minty aromatics/exciting flavours to give a sensorial experience, taking their mind off those things that are stressing them out whilst they tackle the many tasks in the day.\n\nSoothing is a key element in this opportunity space - the physical effect and sensation it brings in the mouth; as well as the mental effect of comforting yourself, slowly getting back to a calmer, safer (emotional) space. Elevate the sensorial element of the solution - thinking through the 5 senses of the consumer and catering to them to feel balanced and relaxed. Highlight both emotionally what \u201csoothing\u201d means to the different age groups - the type of mental comfort and development is different for younger vs older age cohorts. Focus on after work, before going to bed and distracting moments on the go.\n\nRoom for additional MWBs?\n\nMWB names WIP\n\n\nEND OF PAGE: 37",

The theme links with both **Everyday Rewards** and **Playtime Solutions** by offering refreshment solutions that add a sense of reward or playful enjoyment.\n\nA simple treat linked to a specific activity during the day (e.g., studying, finishing a meal, completing a swimming lesson) that applies to both social and solo moments. It serves as a way to indulge yourself or others after completing tasks throughout the day. Key \u201cReward Moments\u201d should be identified and designed against, making it the ideal treat after a meal or snack, separate from the \u201cCleanse & Refresh\u201d space.\n\nCarve out seasonal, special moments for celebration and innovate to meet specific occasions, such as birthdays, Ramadan breaking the fast, Diwali, or seasonal events like Halloween. Elevate these shared celebratory moments with cross-category and brand solutions, focusing on everyone\u2019s favorite flavors and quantities suitable for sharing on these occasions.\n\nMake everyday moments extraordinary by offering something new and experimental, yet familiar. Product variety is essential, including fun shapes, colors, textures, and unique fruity or flavor experiences that appeal to younger audiences. This category focuses on shareable packaging, creating memorable experiences suitable for engaging activities like gaming or play, particularly for audiences who value good entertainment at affordable prices.\n\n**This MWB focuses on facilitating a special social moment where children and families can share quality time together. Candy variety and playfulness are essential here, as the product must appeal to kids and teens in engaging ways. Positioning the product for fun activities like playing on swings, board games, or e-games creates a refreshing option that competes with popular choices like chocolate bars.**\n\nConsumers are as keen to seek ways to reward their beloved ones as they\u2019re keen to receive a treat from others; beyond the actual celebration, look into gifting solutions that can create the sense of indulgence and reward. The product packaging design and its beauty plays an important role here. Consider targeted demographic approaches and personalized options for individuals.\n\n**Room for additional MWBs?**\nEND OF PAGE: 47",
